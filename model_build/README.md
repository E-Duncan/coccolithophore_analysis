Scripts used to build and interrogate models for Duncan et al. 2023

final_model.py builds a regression model for each province based on the province dataframes build in format_data.

SHAP_function.py is used for the analysis of each province model.

Fig_2_province_3_model_build.ipynb is used for province 2 (which is split for this analysis) to build the model for each part of the province and produce the map figures used in Figure 3.
